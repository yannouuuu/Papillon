                    Papillon's custom system for week number since 01/01/1970

 This part is for handleing the date conversion from JS date, Pronote's week number and our
 "epochWeekNumber" (which try to represent the total number of weeks since the UNIX epoch, aka
 1st January 1970). It can be a little be messy but it's the best way I found to handle the date
 conversion between the different systems. I tried to make it as simple as possible and modular,
 and I added a ton of comments to help u. If you still have a question, feel free to ask me. - NonozgYtb ;)
